Currently, no pre-trained model is saved in this folder. 

Thus, when you run the experiment, the training will start with an initialized model.
And checkpoint models will be automatically saved in this folder for every 10,000 steps.

If you want to use my pre-trained models. 
Please download it from "Data generated by this project" in README.md.

After downloading, you will see a "checkpoint" file in this folder. 
If you want to use the best model, don't change "checkpoint" file.
If you want to use other models to see the training progress, 
change the model path in "checkpoint" file.

For experiment 2, if you want to change parameter C other than 2500 and 5000.
Please create a folder with name "c<number>" under "double_dqn" folder.
